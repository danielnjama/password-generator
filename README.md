# password-generator
use this script to get random passwords- strong and unique. Make the necessary adjustments to suite your needs.
To make changes, open python in the current folder of your project (where mypasswords.py file exists). 
import the file : >> import mypasswords.py as ps
                  >> ps.password(5) #this will generate a five character password

Then make the necessary adjustments from that point.
